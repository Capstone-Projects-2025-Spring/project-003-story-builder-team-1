These generated stories are organized via Agents that take in the user\u2019s prompt as input, and they will critique the AI-generated result after sending the prompt through an LLM. The app will then present these results to the user, who can vote on their favorite for further refinement or start a new session. After playing with this app, the user will feel better equipped with a myriad of options for learning how to refine and adjust AI-generated material, which is a critical step to successfully integrate this technology in workflows for professionals and hobbyists alike."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"conceptual-design",children:"Conceptual Design"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The primary language used to code this application will be JavaScript, with dependencies such as React.js and Express.js used for the frontend and backend, respectively.

These options usually either require too much setup for casual users or provide fewer customization options in the refinement process. ChatGPT, for example, will provide, at most, two Agents at a time, and these Agents only return the output without critiquing it themselves first.
