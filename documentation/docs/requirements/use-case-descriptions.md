# Use-case descriptions
## Use Case 1: Account Creation
As a user, it is crucial that I have an account that stores my stories, agents, and their history.

1. The user accesses the resource and is promtped to sign in or make an account.
2. The user enters their information: email, password, username, etc. If the information is invalid, the user will be prompted to try again.
3. The user selects register. 
4. The user enters their email/username and password and clicks sign in.

## Use Case 2: Agent Creation
As a user, I want to create an agent, and or specify who the agent should try to mimic, to help beginning the story writing process.
1. The user selects create agent.
2. The user specifies any writer/writing style the agent should copy/use.
3. The user specifies what the agent should write.

 ## Use Case 3: Human Input vs Agents Only
 As a user, I want to be able to choose whether or not I want to be an active part of the writing process, or if the agents should handle it all.

 2. The user chooses between two buttons, manual mode (agents stop and wait for further user input) or automatic mode (users complete all steps of the creation process).

3. The user checks offs all the parts of the story writing process they wish to be a part of, therefore forcing the agents to stop their process and wait for user input.
