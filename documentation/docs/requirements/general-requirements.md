# General Requirements

This project will utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically create stories using user input to improve the quality and consistency of the writing. It will be hosted as a web application, allowing the user to access the project through any browser. As such, the only requirement for the user will be a device that can access the internet.
