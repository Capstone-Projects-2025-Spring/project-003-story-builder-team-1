# Description
This image represents a high-level architecture for an AI-powered storytelling web application. 
Users interact through a browser interface built with React to provide prompts and offer feedback on generated chapters. 
The frontend communicates with a backend AI Processing System that manages interactions with AI agents and an LLM API to generate story content. 
AI agents vote on the best chapters, and the system returns the winning content to users while storing it in a database alongside complete stories and user data for future retrieval. 
The architecture supports collaborative and dynamic content creation using advanced AI models.
