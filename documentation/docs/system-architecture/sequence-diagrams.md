# Sequence Diagrams

## Initial Writing Story Process Sequence Diagram 
Many sequence diagrams use this initial sequence. Each Diagram that continues after this sequence will clarify that it continues from this sequence.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend/Agent
    participant LLM
    participant Database
    User->>+Frontend: The User provides Agent(s) a prompt for story
    Frontend->>+Backend/Agent: Story Creation Request based on prompt
    Backend/Agent->>+LLM: Send user prompt for story creation to the LLM
    LLM-->>-Backend/Agent: Return story generated by the LLM
    Backend/Agent->>+Database: Store generated story request
    Database-->>-Backend/Agent: Returns document with entry id
    Backend/Agent-->>-Frontend: Return request successful response message
    Frontend-->>-User: Display story generated by Agent to User
```

## Use Case 1: Account Creation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant Database
    User->>+Frontend: User clicks "Sign Up"
    Frontend-->>User: Redirect to Registration page
    loop Until valid email address is provided
        User->>Frontend: User enters information
        Frontend->>+Backend: Send credentials for authentication
        Backend->>Database: Check database for emails
        alt if Email exists
            Database-->>Backend: Returns existing email
            Backend-->>Frontend: Authentication failure response
            Frontend-->>User: Show "User already exists" message
            Frontend-->>User: Prompts User to try again
        else if Email does not exist
            Database-->>Backend: Returns no email
            Backend-->>Frontend: Authentication success response
            Frontend-->>User: Show "Account successfully created" message
            Frontend-->>User: Redirect to Login Page
        end
    end
